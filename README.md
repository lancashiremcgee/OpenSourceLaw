# OpenSourceLaw
This is open source law. I am interested in seeing what 'the law' would look like as an open-source project. It is fully public, anybody can make edits to it. I think that it would be interesting to see what the law would look like as fully produced by anybody who is capable of making a git commit, or being able to get somebody to agree to do it for them. I will not manage this project, I just want to see how it evolves.
